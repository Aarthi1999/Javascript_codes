/*Assume there is a object of this format 
var obj = {
 “id” : 4, “name” : “abc”,
 “id” : 10, “name” : “ab2”,
 “id” : 5, “name” : “abc3”,
 “id” : 6, “name” : “abc5”
}
It can be a dictionary or java object, as per your language of choice. But its key/value pair dictionary simply.

Write a code to sort the object by id 
I.e final output should have objected sort by id’s*/
