# Javascript_codes
Question 1=> Even_number.js
Define an array of numbers (use any random numbers). 
Write a program to print only the even numbers of the array. 
Do not use any library functions, need to do via for loops only

Question 2=>consecutive_1's_in_arry.js
Find the maximum consecutive 1's in an array of 0's and 1's.
Example:
a) 00110001001110 - Output :3 [Max num of consecutive 1's is 3]
b) 1000010001 - Output :1 [Max num of consecutive 1's is 1]

Question 3=>find_repeating_number.js
Suppose you have an array of 101 integers. 
This array is already sorted and all numbers in this array are consecutive. 
Each number only occurs once in the array except one number which occurs twice.
Write a js code to find the repeated number.
e.g $arr = array(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,8,9,10...................);

Question 4=>
Assume there is a object of this format 
var obj = {
 “id” : 4, “name” : “abc”,
 “id” : 10, “name” : “ab2”,
 “id” : 5, “name” : “abc3”,
 “id” : 6, “name” : “abc5”
}
It can be a dictionary or java object, as per your language of choice. But its key/value pair dictionary simply.
Write a code to sort the object by id 
I.e final output should have objected sort by id’s

Question 1=>married_numbers_2to25.js
Married Numbers
A pair of numbers are married if one perfectly divides the other.
What number is married to all numbers between 2 and 25?

Question 2=>prgm_recursion.js
f(1)=1
f(x)=(x-1)*f(x-1)
s(x)=sum of digits of x
Example f(5)=24 and s(f(5))=6
What is s(f(101))?

Question 3=>Friendly_numbers.js
The friend of a number is the sum of its perfect divisors, E.g.,Friend of 18 is 21 (1+2+3+6+9)
2 numbers are best friends of they are friends with each other E.g., Friend of 220 is 284 and friend of 284 is 220.
What is the sum of all best friends under 10000?
